# man I love public transport

Started as an deranged idea at [Cebula Camp 2025](https://cebula.camp/en).

> _Moquette is a type of woven pile fabric in which cut or uncut threads form a
short dense cut or loop pile. The pile's upright fibres form a flexible,
durable, non-rigid surface with a distinctive velvet-like feel. Traditional
moquette weave fabrics are made today from a wool nylon face with an interwoven
cotton backing, and are ideally suited to applications such as public transport._

> _In computer graphics, a shader is a programmable operation which is applied
to data as it moves through the rendering pipeline. Shaders can act on
data such as vertices and primitives — to generate or morph geometry — and
fragments — to calculate the values in a rendered image._
